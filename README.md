Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset

This study focuses on unraveling the mysteries of sleep and lifestyle health through a systematic approach. Initially, we delved into understanding the characteristics of our sample by employing data preprocessing techniques and visualizations. Subsequently, we developed a linear regression model to forecast sleep duration, considering various influencing factors. Our investigation expanded to utilizing a decision tree model to predict sleep disorders based on specific variables. Furthermore, we employed diverse machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, KNN, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, to forecast sleep quality based on lifestyle factors. The project culminated in both research and practical applications, offering insights into the interplay of sleep and lifestyle. Classification reports were employed to determine the most effective model for the given context.
